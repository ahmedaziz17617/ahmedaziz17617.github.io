    <b>Chess</b>
   <p>Chess is life on a miniature board. Every move you make will have a consequence. The result is purely based on how you performed. Nothing else. For me, chess is a fun pass time and also a reminder that nothing comes easy. You have to fight for it. My username on chess.com is Ahmedaziz17617 and I'm in the 95th percentile in rapid formant, in the world :D</p>
   <b>Writing</b>
   <p>I enjoy the theraputic value that writing has to offer. Penning down my thoughts or just writing about any topic of interest helps me reset and restart.</p>

   <b>Football</b>
   <p>Football has always been a way to vent out and have a good time with friends. Eversince I started my Professional career I don't get as much time to play but back in the day I was a member of my college and university team. Good old days!</p>
