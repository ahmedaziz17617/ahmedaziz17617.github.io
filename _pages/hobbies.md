    <b style="margin-bottom: 5px; margin-top: 5px;">Chess</b>
   <p style="margin-bottom: 5px; margin-top: 5px;">Chess is life on a miniature board. Every move you make will have a consequence. The result is purely based on how you performed, nothing else. For me, chess is a fun pass time and also a reminder that nothing comes easy. You have to fight for it. My username on chess.com is Ahmedaziz17617 and I'm in the 95th percentile in rapid format, in the world :D</p>
   <b style="margin-bottom: 5px; margin-top: 5px;">Writing</b>
   <p style="margin-bottom: 5px; margin-top: 5px;">I enjoy the theraputic value that writing has to offer. Penning down my thoughts or just writing about any topic of interest helps me reset and restart.</p>

   <b style="margin-bottom: 5px; margin-top: 5px;">Football</b>
   <p style="margin-bottom: 5px; margin-top: 5px;">Football has always been a way to vent out and have a good time with friends. Eversince I started my Professional career I don't get as much time to play but back in the day I was a member of my college and university team. Good old days!</p>
