    <ul style="margin-bottom: 5px; margin-top: 5px; row-gap:2px">
        <li>We use Luna uncensored from Llama</li>
        <li>The model is connected with Chroma DB which is loaded with LangChain</li>
        <li>ChromaDB maintains vectorized embeddings in the form of chunks. This allows direct queries to obtain data that our LLM can present to the user in a readable form.</li>
        <li>The model is fine tuned on internal use cases such as summary generation.</li>
        <li>All of the above essentially allows the model to function as an AI analyst that helps the user throughout the portal in different use cases.</li>
